# Sprint 3 User Stories

| Story # | User Story | Priority | Type |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | As a researcher, I want a bounding box on the image input display to indicate the area being detected as the core, so that I can visually verify what part of the image is being analyzed. | High | Core Analysis |
| 2 | As a researcher, I want the option to adjust or add the bounding box to change what is read as the core for cases where data parsing or concatenation is needed, so that I can accurately define the coreâ€™s position. | Medium | Core Analysis |
| 3 | As a researcher, I want top and bottom labels added to the representation of the core in the GUI, so that I can easily identify the length and orientation of the core. | High | Plotting / Display |
| 4 | As a researcher, I want the option to rotate the input image by 90 degrees in the GUI and data output, so that I can correctly align the core without needing to manually adjust it beforehand. | High | Plotting / Display 
| 5 | As a researcher, I want to be able to toggle y-axis (core depth) ticks on the GUI graph display, so that I can customize the graph for presentations or detailed analysis. | Medium | Plotting / Display |
| 6 | As an end-user, I want graph labels to appear bold to improve the readability of the graphs. | High | Plotting / Display |
| 7 | As a researcher, I want the GUI to highlight the graph values relative to the moused-over position on the core representation, so that I can easily link the visual core features with corresponding graph data. | Medium | Plotting / Display |
| 8 | As a researcher, I want the ability to zoom in on the core representation and graph displays, so that I can take a closer look at specific details. | High | Plotting / Display |
| 9 | As a researcher, I want to be able to open multiple panels so I can analyse different core images side-by-side. | High | Plotting / Display |
| 10 | As an end-user, I want the option to export a summary of an image context and graphs as PDFs, so I can save and share results more easily. | High | General |
| 11 | As a researcher, I want the ability to reload a previous image's display and output to quickly view and compare previous work without having to reprocess the image. | Low | General |
| 12 | As a researcher, I want a loading animation to be displayed while I am waiting for the image I have selected to be loaded and processed by the application | Medium | General |
| 13 | As an end-user, I want the application to be bundled into a single executable so it is easy to run and share | High | General |
| 14| As a researcher, I want to be able to press a button to recalibrate the output units of the graph based on a sediment core width I enter into the application |Medium | Core Analysis |
| 15 | As an end-user, I want to be able to press a button on the GUI to bring up a user guide so I can quickly learn how to use the application | High | General |
| 16 | As a researcher, I want to be able to export core analysis results to an excel spreadsheet | High | Analysis |
