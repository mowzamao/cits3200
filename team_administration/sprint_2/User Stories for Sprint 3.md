User Stories for Sprint 3

1. As a researcher, I want top and bottom labels added to the representation of the core in the GUI, so that I can easily identify the length and orientation of the core.  

2. As a researcher, I want the option to rotate the input image by 180 degrees in the GUI and data output, so that I can correctly align the core without needing to manually adjust it beforehand.  

3. As a researcher, I want to compare multiple sediment cores against each other with multiple output graphs, so that I can directly compare the stratigraphy of different cores.  

4. As a researcher, I want a split-screen graph display for multiple cores, so that I can view different core data side by side for easier comparison.  

5. As an end-user, I want the option to export graph results as PDFs, so that I can save and share the visualizations easily.  

6. As a researcher, I want to choose whether or not to include ticks on the GUI graph display for each data point, so that I can customize the graph for presentations or detailed analysis.  

7. As a researcher, I want the ability to reload a previous image's display and output to quickly view and compare previous work without having to reprocess the image.  

8. As a researcher, I want graph labels to appear bold to improve the readability of the graphs.  

9.  As a researcher, I want the GUI to highlight the graph value relative to the moused-over position on the core representation, so that I can easily link the visual core features with corresponding graph data.  

10.  As a researcher, I want a bounding box on the image input display to indicate the area being detected as the core, so that I can visually verify what part of the image is being analyzed.
  
11.  As a researcher, I want the option to adjust or add the bounding box to change what is read as the core for cases where data parsing or concatenation is needed, so that I can accurately define the coreâ€™s position.  

12.  As a researcher, I want the ability to zoom in on the core representation and graph displays, so that I can take a closer look at specific details.  

13. As a researcher, I want a loading symbol when the app is processing the input, so that I know the app is working and not frozen during larger image loads.(\# Just an idea discussed but not mentioned by the client.)
