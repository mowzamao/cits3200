# Risk Register

Sediment Analysis Project

| Class | Risk  | Negative Outcome  | Mitigation Plan  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *Quality* | Our software and code meets client requirements but is difficult to use in the field. | Reduced functionality and usability. | Consider implementing and/or planning what the project's MVP (Minimum Value Product) might look like.  Frequently consult with clients (in accordance with Agile and Scrum methodologies). Provide clients with mock-up GUIs and detailed descriptions of potential user experience. Develop and rely on user stories to understand how the client interacts with the project. Develop suitable documentation |
| *Quality* | Inadequate acceptance tests.  | Assessing the quality of the team’s performance at the end of sprints 2 and 3 may be impaired if pre-defined tests don’t cover what was developed in those sprints.  | Discuss tests in group meetings so that a diverse range of ideas \- on where the project is going – can be fed into the acceptance tests. |
| *Quality* | Incorrect output of colour data and graphs due to incorrect backend implementation.  | The output of the project is wrong, making the project unusable.  | Before project delivery, test our system using photos and colour values from similar studies.  |
| *Quality* | The system doesn’t identify and communicate to the user when false values may occur in output (e.g. photos are too low quality, photos are cropping out parts of the core) | If the user's input (core photo) is inadequate, if they are not informed, the user may be misled about the accuracy of the output.  | Encourage the users and client to take high-quality input photos. Ensure we develop a system to show users relevant error messages. |
| *Quality* | Documentation meets requirements but is inaccessible and difficult to understand for inexperienced tech users.  | Users who have not used the project in a while may struggle to use it or to re-learn the system.  | Write highly granular, specific documentation with clear, concise and easy-to-understand instructions.  Develop the documentation in liaison with the client to gauge the effectiveness of the documentation's instructions. |
| *Quality* | The performance of systems is hampered by the memory intensiveness of high-resolution image processing.  | May reduce the functionality of the program if it takes time to process user inputs.  | Discuss the ideal hardware specifications with the client.  Write efficient code (e.g. use linear algebra instead of iterating over arrays) |
| *Quality* | The project and its systems may break if non-image files are inputted.  | Could break or cause issues when later using the application. | Implement a system that checks and screens all inputted files.  |
| *Scope* | Misunderstanding project requirements.   | The software developed for the client doesn’t meet their needs. Functionality and usefulness are reduced.  | Conduct and review the $100 test on project requirements.  Attempt to understand why the client valued the project's requirements. |
| *Scope* | Client-side project requirements change.  | Some software and code may be made redundant resulting in wasted effort and time. | Frequent consultation with clients (in accordance with Agile and Scrum methodologies). |
| *Scope* | The application of the project and its software conflicts with the wishes and expectations expressed by cultural heritage-related stakeholders. | The geological cores being analysed are sourced from a culturally significant Indigenous site.  Potential positives from the project and its later research could be negated if our methodologies conflict with the wishes of Indigenous stakeholders.  | Stay up to date with communication from the client about these potential issues.  The client has communicated to the team that permission has been granted.				 |
| *Scope* | Intellectual Property issues arise during the development or later application of the project.  | Incorrect licensing may make the project application in the field more difficult if licensing is reported on incorrectly.  | Follow universities and the client’s guidelines for licensing requirements. Communicate with clients on any further issues as they arise during project development.  |
| *Time* | Time constraints risk the completion of project deliverables. | Critical elements of the project requirements may be missing when delivered to the client.  | Clearly define the project's scope in the first sprint. Agree upon a realistic scope with the client. Develop a hierarchy of requirements, so critical requirements are completed first ($100 Test). Assign roles and tasks to team members to improve efficiency and maintain accountability.  Adjust the scope where necessary in accordance with agile and scrum principles. Efficiently communicate these changes to the client. |
| *Time* | Time pressure due to the development learning curve increases the difficulty of meeting the project requirements.  | Completing project deliverables may become more difficult and take more time.  | Discuss preferences for development frameworks in group meetings so that the most suitable framework is chosen.  Decide which framework to use in the planning stage so that developers can learn the required new skills before coding/development begins.  |
| *Time / Quality* | Difficulty combining and integrating work completed by team members. | Potentially reduced code quality and greater difficulty meeting project requirements/deliverable deadlines and maintaining code. | Assign roles and tasks to each team member during sprints. Effectively use version control software (frequent commits, clean branches, detailed code reviews etc.). |
| *Time / Quality* | Software maintenance post-delivery of project.  | Implementing an installation wizard makes installation easier. However, as hardware and operating systems evolve, the project's systems may develop issues over time.  | Discuss this issue with the client. Write code that minimises dependencies on specific hardware and operating systems. |
| *Time / Quality* | The project meets the client's requirements but is slow to process inputs.  | The functionality of the project is diminished as the user may encounter long wait times.  | Follow the testing schedule.  Ensure each unit test examines whether processing time is acceptable.					 |
| *Time / Scope* | Under-estimating time requirements of deliverables.  | Risks falling behind on the project’s progress and leaving some requirements unfinished upon final delivery.  | Follow the advice provided by our mentor. When allocating time in the planning stage, double our initial estimates. |

Time: 6, Quality 10, Scope 5

**Risk Register:**

The following risk register was created to document potential risks and how they may affect the project's viability. The risk register outlines potential mitigation strategies to reduce the probability that these risks materialise into real issues. Broadly speaking, there are two classes of identified risks associated with this project. The first risk class is technical and relates to whether specific systems in the project's software delivered the necessary and expected outcomes.  Examples of risks that fall into this class include the risk that our project processes and returns incorrect data to the user or that our project doesn’t alert the user when a potential error has occurred. The second class of risks relate to risks associated with project management. These risks are more related to team management, communication and planning. Many of the suggested mitigation strategies relate to project management theory and the correct implementation of Agile software development methodologies. Identification, documentation and implementation of these risks and their mitigation strategies ensures a higher likelihood of successful project delivery to the client. 

Risks that are categorized into the first class of risks (technical are outlined below).
