## Project Demonstration:

- Our client is very impressed by the progress so far.
- Happy with the completion of the main functionality.

**Our client has a number of additional feature suggestions for the next sprint:**
1. Button for rotating the sediment core image, so researchers can choose the sediment core orientation.
2. Option to display new images and graphs on new GUI panels
    - Currently, the application only allows one image to be analysed at one time, overwriting the current display when a new image is selected.
    - When a new image is imported, it should be displayed in a new panel / tab.
3. Button for exporting plots as a PDF.
    - Should invoke a form for selecting the plot title, axis ticks, plot size and plot style.
4. Button for plotting the three colour channels on a single axis
    - Currently, each colour channel has it's own axis.

**Our client has requested the following changes to current features:**
1. Improve core visualisation clarity by adding 'Top' and 'Bottom' labels to describe the core's orientation
2. Plot titles should be in bold to improve readability

**The team suggested the following features and changes to the client, which the client agreed with:**
1. Adding an adjustable 'bounding box' to the visualisation of the sediment core detected in the image by the application, so researchers can be certain that the colour data being analysed is that of the sediment core
2. Adding the ability to select a sediment core layer to be highlighted in the plot
3. Adding the option to reload the previous image and analysis
4. Adding the option to select a subsection of the sediment core for analysis
5. Adding a loading screen when processing a sediment core
    - Current processing time is around 5 seconds, during which it looks like the application is frozen.

**Our client would like us to continue developing the following Sprint 2 user stories in Sprint 3:**
1. Mapping from detected colours to Munsell colour indices
    - Our client expressed this is low priority
2. Exporting core analysis results to excel spreadsheet

### General Business
- Our client would like to publish our application and results in a paper, including our team as co-authors
    - We need to provide detailed documentation regarding the sediment core extraction and colour analysis processes

Meeting closed at: 1:59pm
