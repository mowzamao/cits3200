Meeting start at 2:12 pm

## Preview of Sprint 2 (getting down to the actual project)
- Start somewhere, write some code, then improve to make it more readable, correct, and optimise
- Be clear on what your expectations are and make sure to understand teammates expectations when communicating tasks
- Keep it basic, and go back to basics when overloaded/stressed
- Always ask for help if lost, no matter how bad you're lost
## How to approach being bottlenecked
- There is always risk associated, need to highlight possible problems with due-by dates
- Use Jira to map dependencies and break down tasks
- Communicate risks to client along with the project scope and idea
## Lowest granularity for breaking down tasks
- Depends on the person/team
- Can break down tasks into requirements to complete user stories, and typically no further
- Again, doable in a day is the goal
## For more than one person working on the same task
- Don't, allocate one task per person
- Maybe even make one person in charge of a particular user story during a sprint
- - Also makes it a complete section of the project this person becomes in charge of, including testing
- Also make sure to create minimum complete unit test for tasks when in charge
## General notes and tips
- Sai does Safe-Agile at Idoba, essentially financial quarter-based Agile
- Waterfall can be useful, but context dependant
- - Product-based needs to be Agile focused, due to needing market validation and adjustment for final product
- Very little desktop applications and little need for packaging 
- As a developer Sai spends average 70-80% of time programming, as a tech lead Sai spends more time smoothing the workflow through documentation
- Try to appreciate each other while helping
