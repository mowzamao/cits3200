## Agenda

### Introductions
- Sai is a Technical Lead at idoba

### Project Preview
- emailed link to project description to Sai
- Our current project scope / description:
    - Constructing an offline desktop application for personal use of Dr Ingrid Ward
    - Application must take a colour image of a sediment core and construct downloadable graphs of the changes in colour across the image, as well as .csv files of the raw data.

### Sprint 1 Preview
- Sai recommends we start using Trello now for tracking our deliverables and user stories
    - We should number the user stories on trello and use these as the first part of our git messages to make our logs easier to read.
- Use Github comments for code review
- Keep our scope as simple as possible
    - Ask open, rather than closed questions, because clients tend to think every possible feature sounds good and necessary

### General Advice
- Ensure the license of our software is compatible with the licenses of all dependencies (i.e. libraries)
- Break project down into tasks that can be completed in one day

Date of Next Meeting: Week of 26/08
