## Project Retrospective:
### Goal completion:
- Feeling good about tasks completed, most of the client feedback was to do with additional functionality to be worked on in Sprint 3
- Have completed 3 out of the 10 user stories, with progress already made to complete 5 of the remaining 7
- - Looking to drop user stories number 5 and number 9, due to change for multiple input images for multiple output graphs and difficulty in scope respectively
### Timeline completion:
- Making excellent progress to complete all base product functionality during Sprint 3
- Looking mainly to adding optional functionality in scope for Sprint 3
- Mostly cutting down on estimates for timesheet, despite completing expected amount of work for sprint 2

## General Business:
- Core is an 78mm or 80mm standardised core width
