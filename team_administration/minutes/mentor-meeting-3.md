## Discussed how to naviagate client interactions
- For demoing MVP, recommended have minimum instructions for the client to use, and take down questions the client is asking as improvement for future instructions and functionality
- Have a look of streamlit/streamlight for future web application design simply through python
- More user feedback for performing actions is good
- For webpage testing, cyprus can be used to automatically check for if stuff exists on the page after following certain actions
- It's often the case that the client comes up with new ideas once the base project is complete or certain functionality has been made. Usually ends up being lower scope and important to keep these tasks as optional even if stressed by client
- - Important to check for if a task is part of the original scope for taking in priority, and then decide if the additional scope is chargeable or capitalizable

## Discussed software development good practices
- Remember to put specs with documentation including basic benchmarks
- Can try to use tags on GitHub for version numbering
- Try to find how installer library uses synthesizing
- - Also can try package executable through docker
- Comments are the most useful when paired with complex logic
- - Also comments are not great once the logic is changed, as they also need updating to match
