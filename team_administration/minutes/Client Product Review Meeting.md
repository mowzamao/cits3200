## Project Demonstration:
### Client thoughts:
- Looking for adding top and bottom labels to representation of core in GUI
- Looking to add option to rotate input image by 180 degrees in GUI and for reading data
- Looking to compare multiple cores against each other with multiple corresponding output displays
- - Potentially looking for split screen graphing results
- Looking for option to export graph results as pdf
- Looking to make GUI graph labels bold
- Likes BGR colour-coded GUI graph display
- May want to normalise data results to single graph, client will look into it
- Looking to reload a previous image's display and output, links back to comparing multiple cores
- - May be multiple page/tab windows to switch between
- - Likes idea of having quick reload of previously loaded input, suggested by team
- Really happy with functionality
- Looking to choose to include ticks on GUI graph display per data point
- Looking to reference and include our documentation and planning as points in report
- - Looking to also include us as co-authors and in publishing
### Team thoughts:
- Can add graph highlight relative to moused-over value of core representation, Ingrid likes
- Looking to add loading symbol when app is buffering input
- Looking to finalise Munsell colour index mapping on data output and graph display, Ingrid says is low priority
- Looking to display a box over the image input display to show what exactly is being detected, Ingrid likes
- - Looking to also adjust this box to change what is read as the core in the image
- - Looking to also be able to add a box to change what is read as the core for potentially concatenating data parsing
- Looking to add zooming to graph and core representation displays
- Looking to add as much functionality to help analyse and compare results that we can think of
