## Review goals from last week:
- Rishwanth Worked on exporting graphs and data to user's computer as file
- - Just going to export the colours graph and not the layers graph in the pdf
- Josh went through refactoring code to comment and edit our code, generally clean up
- Josh also looked into having multiple windows in PyQt, and brought up complications that we may run into
- - Doable but will take about 2 weeks to reformat our implementation
- Sophie worked on converting image data from BGR colour space to CIELAB and back, and implementing buttons in GUI to do this
- - Colours will reflect luminosity in either colour space, so conversion to hue won't be lost

## Set meeting time for Mentor meeting:
- Looking to meet Sai at 3:30pm Friday

## Discussed priorities for next week:
- Sophie to do bounding box for image data parsing
- - Already mostly implemented, just needs adding to GUI
- Matt and Sophie looking to add top and bottom labels to image input display and layers graph
- - Matt and Sophie to also work on flipping data display and output
- Matt has already done bolding titles for graph displays
- Josh to do zooming in on graph and layer display
- - Also Josh to look further into formatting multiple windows in the GUI
- Blair to look into cross compatibility for executable
- Rishwanth to look into adding option to export as excel spreadsheet file
- Blair to look into adding adjustable bounding box on image input display to change the data in the image that is parsed
