## Process Reflection

### What Went Well

* We efficiently identified, discussed, and allocated tasks week-to-week.  
* We subdivided our tasks into the relatively independent streams of GUI design and sediment analysis, resulting in smooth, concurrent progress.  
* All team members consistently attended group meetings and mostly completed their assigned tasks within the proposed deadlines, with only occasional delays due to the unavailability of client data. 
* We completed our tasks to a high standard, and the client was pleased with our progress.  
* We completed our MVP in-line with the client's desired priorities 

### What Did Not Go So Well

* Team members developing interconnected components did not discuss their assumptions regarding inputs and outputs. This made it difficult to combine the features into a single product.  
* Our initial plans were overoptimistic, and we overestimated the number of user stories we could complete within the sprint timeframe.  
* While we didn't finish all the user stories planned for sprint 2, the client identified many as unnecessary or low-priority, allowing us to refocus our efforts on completing high-priority tasks.  
* Our lack of planning regarding GitHub merging practices led to confusing regarding how and when to merge branches.  
* We must establish clear guidelines regarding who needs to review code prior to merging and the type of merging to use.

### What Can Be Improved

* We should implement rigorous standardised testing for each new feature.   
  * Often, when implementing a new feature for the GUI, old features would break or not work on other team member's devices. Stricter testing will ensure that these problems are found early.  
* We must ensure to communicate more promptly with our client, project mentor, and auditor.  
  * Occasionally, we were sending emails about meetings only a few days in advance, making it difficult to avoid scheduling conflicts.  
* We must check the marking criteria for each sprint and deliverable thoroughly.  
  * Sometimes, we would make assumptions about what a deliverable should look like only to find that the marking criteria suggested something different.  
  * To prevent this from happening, all team members should look at the deliverable descriptions and marking criteria when making decisions.  
* We should increase our utilisation of project management tools like Trello to improve our productivity and maintain communication between team members.  
  * We started sending short text files to each other about what tasks we thought needed to be completed rather than having official documentation available to the whole team.  
  * Updating our Trello dashboard regularly will mean less time is spent confirming with each other what tasks have been completed and what tasks are left to complete.

## Goal completion

* The most important functionality has been completed, and the client expressed she was happy with how the project was progressing.  
* Most of the clientâ€™s feedback regarded additional functionality in Sprint 3\.

### Timeline completion:

* The team is making excellent progress in completing all base product functionality during Sprint 3  
* Looking mainly to adding optional functionality in scope for Sprint 3  
* Mostly cutting down on estimates for timesheet, despite completing expected amount of work for sprint 2
