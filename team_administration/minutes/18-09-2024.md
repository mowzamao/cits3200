## Review goals from last week:
- Blair ran into major issues with packaging single executable with PyInstaller, as it runs into problems with Qt plugin paths
- - Also tried using a separate installer using Nuitka but it runs into problems with PyQt6 modules not being compiled
- - Suggesting downgrading to PySide6 or PyQt5 to make Nuitka work, preferring PyQt5 for most online support
- - Group agrees to downgrade to PyQt5, mostly likely needing to task someone to fix version issues that arise
